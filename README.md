# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Prevents budget overuns,maintain stake holders confidence,reduces risks of scope creep,ensures market competiveness.
Deadlines are met through effective planning,task prioritization,regular monitoring and risk management.
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Effective cost control ensures project copmletion within financial costraints and prevents resource wastage.
Strategies to be used are ;Regular budget tracking,scope management to avoid unnecessary feature additions,resourse allocation optimization, and accurate cost estimation.
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile methodologies are flexible,faster with incremental releases,has low risk and is best for dynamic evolving projects while Waterfall methodologies are sequential,slower as testing is done at the end,high risk and best for well defined stable projects.
Agile advantages-faster delivery of features,encourages collaboration,adapts to changing requirements.Disadvantages;can lead to scope creep,requires frequent client involvement.
Waterfall advantagees-clear structure and documentation,better for fixed scope projects.Disadvantages-difficult to implement changes,late discovery of issues increases risks.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is better for startup and fast changing industries e.g mobile app development,Waterfall is better for well defined regulated industries e.g banking
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Code reviews
Automated testing
Manual testing
Version control
CI/CD pipelines

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Prevents scope creep
Aligns expectations with stake holders
Improve resource allocation and risk management
Work break down stucture is a hierarchal breakdown of project tasks.
Helps in assigning resonsibilities ,tracking and milestone planning.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
